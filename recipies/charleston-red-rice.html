    <h3>Charleston Red Rice</h3>
    <h2>Ingredient's</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>6 cups boiling water</li>
      <li>2 cups uncooked long-grain white rice</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
      <li>6 slices bacon</li>
      <li>2 onions, chopped</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
      <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>1 dash hot pepper sauce</li>
      <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart
        baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring water, rice, and salt to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to
        medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and most of the
        liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        While rice is cooking, cook bacon in a large, deep skillet over
        medium-high heat until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Reserve about 1
        tablespoon of bacon drippings in the pan. Reduce heat to medium. Drain
        bacon on a plate lined with paper towels; crumble the bacon once cooled
        enough to handle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook and stir onions in the reserved bacon drippings until translucent,
        5 to 8 minutes. Stir in crumbled bacon, tomato sauce, tomato paste,
        sugar, Worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce; bring the mixture to a
        simmer, reduce heat, and continue to simmer for 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon cooked rice into the prepared baking dish and stir the
        tomato-bacon mixture into the rice until evenly combined.
      </li>
      <li>Cover the dish and bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
